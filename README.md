This project demonstrates my understanding of full-stack development, including frontend–backend integration, REST API design, authentication, file handling, and database relationships. It reflects real-world application flow such as role-based access, protected routes, and scalable code structure.



Blog Application | MERN Stack Project

Developed a full-stack blog application using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Built full CRUD functionality for blog posts with image upload support using Multer.

Designed a My Posts dashboard allowing users to view, edit, and delete only their own posts.

Demonstrated frontend–backend integration, database relationships, and real-world application flows such as role-based access and scalable code structure.
